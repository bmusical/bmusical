# 👋 Harvey Myers | HxM Blazor Software
### **Senior Architect | Blazor Specialist | .NET 10 & AI-Augmented Development**

I’ve been shipping commercial software since the mainframe era. From **COBOL** and **DOS 1.1** to modern **Blazor WebAssembly**, I’ve spent four decades turning complex business problems into elegant code. After a decade-long "intermission" as a professional musician, I’ve returned to the IDE to leverage the latest in **.NET 10** and **AI-driven development.**

**⚡ Fun Fact:** I spent the last decade as a professional musician/singer—now I bring that same rhythm and precision back to software architecture. 

> **Pronouns:** Guru? Some think so—I just think I've seen enough "frustratingly slow" computers to know how to make them move.

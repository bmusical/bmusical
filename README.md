### Projects in 👋  in Blazor, and Net.Core.
I've been developing software commercially since the days of the mainframe when COBOL ruled. 
After cutting my teeth with Burroughs, DEC/VAX and HP-3000's, I stepped aboard the Microsoft Train from DOS 1.1 forward. 
I was an early MCP and MCSD, and have stayed informed as these products all developed, using some here and there 
It's been fun, frustrating at times. Computers are still too slow. I digress..

I have written software from scratch for business types from Borrow Pits to Home Shopping Network to NASDAQ Stock Trading. I've worked, written and interfaced to all types of accounting, human resources, and inventory systems. Custom software I've written was fit into machine shops, medical equipment manufacturers, general contractors, vending service, warehousing, Media delivery service (like Muzac), remote backup and at-home stock trading through to the NASDAQ. I have worked with teams to develop software products for resale. Alternatively, I have written custom line-of-work system for a single company more than once. I once won a national award from parent company, CompuServe, when CompuServe was king. Still pretty good at debugging and conversion.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ First shot at creating a Git profile. 

I've been developing software commercially since the days of the mainframe when COBOL ruled. 
After cutting my teeth with Burroughs, DEC/VAX and HP3000's, I stepped aboard the Microsoft Train from DOS 2.0 forward. 
I was an early MCP and MCSD, and have wither active or not, kept informed as these products all developed. 
Its been fun. 

I have written software, some from scratch to cover business types from Borrow Pits to NASDAQ Stock Trading. I've worked, written or interfaced to all types of accounting, HR and invntory systems. Software I've written or worked on Tracked costs and prodction for a machine shop, medical equipment manufacturer, general contrator, vending service, warehousing, Media delivery service, remote backup and at-home stock trading through to the NASDAQ. I won a national award when working for a subsidiery of CompuServe, when CompuServe was king. Still pretty good at debugging.
